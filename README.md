# Pixel Art Maker

A simple, single page web app which allows a user to create pixel art on a grid
which is dynamically generated according to the user's input.

This application combines HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a web application
which utilises a user's input (in the form of **integers**) to create a HTML
table which functions as a pixel art canvas.
